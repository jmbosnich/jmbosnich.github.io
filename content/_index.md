I am a Ph.D. student at Northwestern University supervised by Prof. Todd Murphey in the [Interactive & Emergent Autonomy Lab](https://murpheylab.github.io/) and the [Center for Robotics and Biosystems](https://robotics.northwestern.edu/). I received a B.A. in pure mathematics and a B.S. in mechanical engineering from CU, Boulder.

I'm passionate about control theory, dynamical systems, data-driven modeling, and autonomous systems.
