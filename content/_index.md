Hi, my name is Jonathan, and I love math & engineering!

Currently, I'm a part-time math instructor at Loyola University, where I also work on applying Koopman operator theory to set-valued dynamics with Rafal Goebel. I recently completed an M.S. at Northwestern University; my thesis on robust data-driven stabilization supervised by Todd Murphey can be found here. I received a B.A. in math and a B.S. in mechanical engineering from the University of Colorado, Boulder.

**I'm seeking a PhD program** in some combination of control theory, dynamical systems, and optimization.
