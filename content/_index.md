I'm a Ph.D. student in Systems Science and Mathematics at Washington University in St. Louis, where I work on modeling and controlling complex dynamical systems under the mentorship of Xudong Chen. 

I did an M.S. under Todd Murphey at Northwestern University; my thesis on robust data-driven control can be found [here]({{< ref "research" >}}). I have a B.A. in pure math and a B.S. in mechanical engineering from the University of Colorado.
