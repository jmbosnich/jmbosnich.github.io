Hi! My name is Jonathan (Jonny) Bosnich.

I am a Ph.D. student at Northwestern University supervised by Professor Todd Murphey in the [Interactive and Emergent Autonomy Lab](https://murpheylab.github.io/) and affiliated with the [Center for Robotics and Biosystems](https://robotics.northwestern.edu/).

I am interested in theoretical and data-driven nonlinear systems and control.
