Hi, my name is Jonathan, and I love math & engineering!

I'm currently a math instructor at Loyola University, where I also work on applying Koopman operator theory to set-valued dynamics with Rafal Goebel. I recently completed an M.S. under Todd Murphey at Northwestern University; my thesis on robust data-driven stabilization can be found here. I received a B.A. in math and a B.S. in mechanical engineering from the University of Colorado.

**I'm seeking a PhD program** focused on theoretical and computational control, systems, and optimization.
