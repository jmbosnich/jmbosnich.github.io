The aim of this blog is to candidly share stuff that I find cool! Naturally, most of the posts will be in the realm of dynamical systems, control theory, data-driven modeling, and so on. However, there will also be plenty of esoteric pure mathematics, concrete and creative applied engineering, pedagogy discussions, and personal reflections. Might even throw in some philosophical ponderings one day. Hope you enjoy!

My first post will come soon!
