The aim of this blog is to candidly share stuff that I find cool! Naturally, most of the posts will be in the realm of dynamical systems, control theory, data-driven modeling, and so on. However, there will also be plenty of esoteric pure mathematics, concrete and creative applied engineering, pedagogy discussions, and personal reflections. Might even throw in some philosophical ponderings one day. Hope you enjoy!

My first post will come soon!

## I Like This Quote (5/8/24)
A wonderful quote from one of the most creative and revolutionary mathematicians of the 2th century reminding us to not fear failure nor to contort our research (or ourselves) to fit into the status quo.

"Discovery is a child's privilege. I mean the small child, the child who is not afraid to be wrong; to look silly, to not be serious, and to act differently from everyone else. [The child] ignores the silent and flawless consensus that is part of the air we breathe---the consensus of all the people who are, or are reputed ro be, reasonable."

-Alexander Grothendieck
