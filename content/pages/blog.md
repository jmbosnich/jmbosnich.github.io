The aim of this blog is to candidly share stuff that I find cool! Naturally, most of the posts will be in the realm of dynamical systems, control theory, data-driven modeling, and so on. However, there will also be plenty of esoteric pure mathematics, concrete and creative applied engineering, pedagogy discussions, and personal reflections. Might even throw in some philosophical ponderings one day. Hope you enjoy!


# Topological Limitations in Control Theory
Before diving into the technical content of this post, let me share that my introduction to point-set topology as an undergraduate at CU University, taught by the brilliant [Agnes Beaudry](https://www.colorado.edu/math/agnes-beaudry), was the most challenging and rewarding experience as an undergraduate. Influence by my engineering education, I *very* reluctantly gave up metric spaces.


# My path to control theory (Dec 20, 2023)
This seems a fitting first blog post as it will involve mathematics, engineering, ample anecdotes, all of which I believe illuminate who I am as an academic and person.
