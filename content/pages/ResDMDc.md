The idea is simple: if we can bound the distance between an eigevalue of the model to an eigenvalue of the true system, we can stabilize the true system by finding feedback that pushes the error balls in a stable region of the complex plane. With this motivation in place, I fearlessly (recklessly?) pushed forward along this research direction.
