# Gardening
I was the president of the Northwestern graduate gardening club *Plant-It Purple* for 2023-2024. In this club we maintained a plot of land on the patio of the Technological Institute (engineering building), where we planted, cared for, and harvested whatever our hearts' desired! Some of my favorite things we grow are strawberries, cherry tomatoes, purple potatoes, rainbow carrots, and Red Warty Thing pumpkins (ugly but delicious).

Just one week's worth of harvest!
