# Gardening
My enthusiasm for gardening began as a kid helping my mom in our backyard garden. After learning how to garden in the harsh conditions of Colorado, I've enjoyed the relative ease and bountiful harvests of gardening in the midwest. In the 2023-24 academic year, I was the president of [Plant-It-Purple](https://www.northwestern.edu/sustainability/news/2017/2017-03-gardens.html), a graduate student gardening club at Northwestern University that has been running for over 15 years. This club maintains a sizable plot of land in the courtyard of the Technological Institute on campus, where we plant, care for, and harvest a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, and herbs. Some of my favorite things we grew this past year were strawberries, rainbow carrots, purple potatoes, orange cherry tomatoes, and Red Warty Thing pumpkins.

# Music, Movies, and Books
My musical interests are all over the place---indie pop rock, minimalistic classical, jazz fusion, hardcore punk, etc., etc. However, if I had to choose, my go-to genre would be classical. For a taste of the kind of classical music I like, check out my Spotify playlist below:

A few of my favorite books:
- Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep (Philip K Dick)
- The Master and Margarita (Mihail Bulgakov)
- No Country for Old Men (Cormac McCarthy) 
    - the movie adaptation by the Coen Brothers is great too

A few of my favorite movies:
- Nomadland (Chloe Zhao)
- Whiplash (Damien Chazelle)
- Anomalisa (Charlie Kaufman)

# The Rocky Mountains
I grew up 30 minutes outside of Rocky Mountain National Park with the view of Longs Peak and Mount Meeker ever present at the end of my street. The Rocky Mountains are breathtaking and have always been a place where I find peace and solace. Here are a few pictures I've taken in the Rockies:
