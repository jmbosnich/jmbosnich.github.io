Hello, and welcome! My name is Jonathan---but everyone calls me Jonny---and I work on interdisciplinary problems in dynamical systems, control theory, and optimization.

I've always had a deep curiosity about why things work the way they do---both in nature and engineering. My parents are both engineers and made a concerted effort to encourage my three siblings and me to be inquisitive and creative, which they primarily accomplished through homeschooling. This was the ideal environment for me to explore all the "why" questions I could come up with and build all sorts of cool stuff during my formative years.

My intellectual curiosity continued to grow and eventually led me to pursue undergraduate degrees in mechanical engineering and pure mathematics at the University of Colorado, Boulder. My coursework took me on a serpentine journey through science, mathematics, and engineering (as well as the humanities). Studying diverse subjects such as abstract algebra, thermodynamics, hardware design, and continental philosophy---all in the same day---was not out of the ordinary. This degree program was engrossing, and I couldn't wait to see the material outside of the classroom.

I completed four separate research projects as an undergraduate: a mathematics research experience for undergraduates (REU) in algebraic combinatorics, a bio-inspired robotics REU where I created a soft-robotic gripper, a computational robotics project in the Bio-Inspired Perception and Robotics Lab, and an independent research project on the classification of 10-dimensional simple Lie algebras over GF(2). While working on this Lie theory project my senior year, my linear systems professor (who knew I was a math major) pulled me aside to tell me that Lie algebraic methods were used for the controllability analysis of nonlinear systems. My eyes widened. Up to that point, my coursework and research in engineering and pure mathematics felt disjointed. Discovering this intersection was perplexing and captivating---I've had an insatiable interest in dynamical systems and control theory ever since. This field feels like a playground for mathematical exploration and creative application across a myriad of disciplines. I'm thrilled to study the theoretical and computational foundations of dynamical systems and control theory as a PhD student starting in the fall of 2025!

Outside of academics, I love being outdoors and seize every opportunity I have to sit and soak up nature, especially in the Rocky Mountains. Some of my favorite hobbies are gardening, playing and watching soccer, rock climbing, going to concerts, and reading. See my [interests]({{< ref "other_interests" >}}) for more details and pictures.

I hope you enjoy poking around this website, and please reach out if you want to connect!
