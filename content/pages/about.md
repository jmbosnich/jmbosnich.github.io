Hello, and welcome! My name is Jonathan, but everyone calls me Jonny. I'm an aspiring applied mathematician working on inderdisciplinary problems in dynamical systems, control theory, and optimization. Below is a brief overview of my academic and personal journey that led me to this amazing field of research.

I've always had a deep curiosity about why things work they way they do---both in nature and in engineering. Both of my parents are engineers, and I was homeschooled by my mom (a mechanical engineer who had prior worked on the Hubble Telescope); so, that is to say, I had the ideal environment and encouragement to explore all the "why" questions I could come up with and build all sorts of cool stuff during my formative years.

My intellectual curiosity continued to grow and eventually led me to pursue undergraduate degrees in mechanical engineering and pure mathematics at the University of Colorado, Boulder. My coursework took me on a truly broad serpentine journey through science, mathematics, and engineering (as well as the humanities). Studying diverse subjects such as abstract algebra, thermodynamics, hardware design, and continental philosohpy---all in the same day---was not out of the ordinary. This degree program was engrossing (and time consuming), and I couldn't wait to see the material outside of the classroom.

I ended up engaging in four separate undergraduate research projects: a mathematics REU in algebraic combinatorics, a bio-inspired robotics REU, computational robotics research in the Bio-Inspired Perception and Robotics Lab, and an independent research project on the classification of 10-dimensional simple Lie algebras over GF(2). While working on this Lie theory project my senior year, I had a truly formative experience. After a lecture on linear controllability in my linear systems course, the instructor (who was also my undergrad research advisor) pulled me aside to tell me that Lie algebraic methods were used for the controllability analysis of nonlinear systems. My eyes widened. Up to this point, much of my coursework and research in pure mathematics and engineering felt distant. In seeing this overlap, I was amazed, perplexed, and extremely eager to learn more. I was hooked. 

Ever since then, I've had an insatiable interest in the mathematics of systems and control theory. This field feels like a playground for mathematical exploration and creative application across a myriad of disciplines. Now, I'm thrilled to start a PhD in theoretical and computational aspects of control theory and dynamical systems starting in the fall of 2025!

Outside of academics, I love being outdoors and seize every opportunity I have to sit and soak up nature, especially in the Rocky Mountains. Some of my favorite hobbies are gardening, playing and watching soccer, rock climbing, going to concerts, and reading. See my [interests]({{< ref "other_interests" >}}) for more details and pictures.

I hope you enjoy poking around this website, and please reach out if you want to connect!
