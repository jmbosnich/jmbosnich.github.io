Like many students studying engineering, I wanted to proverbially "pop the hood" on science and engineering. Why do things work the way they do? How can we exploit knowledge to engineer better systems. 

I have a broad background that spans the spectrum of STEM, from abstract pure mathematics to concrete engineering. I accomplished this by completing a B.A. in mathematics and B.S. in mechanical engineering at the University of Colorado, Boulder. In graduate school at Northwestern University, my interests have gravitated more towards the theoretical side of things, but while still being within reaching distance from real-world application. In particular, I'm passionate about systems and control theory, which I believe strikes this balance perfectly.

The topic of control theory caught my interest during my senior year at CU when my undergraduate research advisor, Sean Humbert, told me about the Lie algebra rank condition for the controllability analysis of nonlinear systems. Honestly, I was shocked! At that time I was also doing an independent study with Keith Kearnes on the classification of 10-dimensional simple Lie algebras over GF(2), and I never would've imagined that theoretical mathematics such as Lie theory would pop up in a controls context. Ever since then, I've had an insatiable interest in the mathematics of systems and control theory. It feels like a playground for mathematical exploration and creative application across a myriad of disciplines.



Outside of academics, I love being outdoors and seize every opportunity I have to sit and soak up nature, especially in the Rocky Mountains. I also enjoy reading a wide variety of books (my favorites are Dick's "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?" and  McCarthy's "No Country for Old Men") and watching movies that are stylistically and/or thematically original (e.g., Kauffman's "Anomalisa" and Zhao's "Nomadland"). My taste in music is also quite eclectic; I listen to everything from baroque classical to indie pop to heavy metal. A fun fact about myself is that I have a playlist on Spotify called "Deep Classical" which has over 1,200 likes! Currently, my favorite band is King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard, composer is Shostakovich, and rapper is Conway the Machine.

Anyway, I hope you enjoy poking around this website, and please reach out if you want to connect!
