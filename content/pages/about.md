Hi and welcome! My name is Jonathan, but everyone calls me Jonny.

I have a broad background that spans the spectrum of STEM, including theoretical mathematics, computational science, and hands-on engineering. I accomplished this by completing a B.A. in mathematics and B.S. in mechanical engineering at the University of Colorado, Boulder. In graduate school at Northwestern University, my interests have gravitated more towards the theoretical side of things, but while still being within reaching distance from real-world application. In particular, I'm passionate about systems and control theory, which I believe strikes this balance perfectly.

The topic of control theory caught my interest during my senior year at CU when my undergraduate research advisor, Sean Humbert, told me about the Lie algebra rank condition for the controllability analysis of nonlinear systems. Honestly, I was shocked! At that time I was also doing an independent study with Keith Kearnes on the classification of 10-dimensional simple Lie algebras over GF(2), and I never would've imagined that theoretical mathematics such as Lie theory would pop up in a controls context. Ever since then, I've had an insatiable interest in the mathematics of systems and control theory. It feels like a playground for mathematical exploration and creative application across a myriad of disciplines.

Outside of academics, I love being outdoors and seize every opportunity I have to sit and soak up nature, especially in the Rocky Mountains. Some of my favorite hobbies are gardening, playing and watching soccer, rock climbing, going to concerts, and reading. See my [interests]({{< ref "other_interests" >}}) for more details and pictures.

I hope you enjoy poking around this website, and please reach out if you want to connect!
