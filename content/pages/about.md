Hello, and welcome! My name is Jonathan---but everyone calls me Jonny---and I work on interdisciplinary problems in control theory, dynamical systems, and optimization.

I've always had a deep curiosity about why things work the way they do---both in the natural and engineered world. This curiosity drove me to pursue undergraduate degrees in mechanical engineering and pure mathematics at the University of Colorado, Boulder. Through this combination of degrees, I gained technical competence in pragmatic engineering and rigorous theory, and I was introduced to a variery of fascinating research topics. As an undergradutae, I completed four different research projects, ranging from building a soft-robotic gripper with force feedback control to chipping away at the classification of 10-dimensional simple Lie algebras over the two-element field. For more details about these projects, visit my [research page]({{< ref "research" >}}).

While working on this Lie theory project my senior year, my linear systems professor (who knew I was a math major) pulled me aside to tell me that Lie algebraic methods were used for the controllability analysis of nonlinear systems. My eyes widened. Up to that point, my coursework and research in engineering and pure mathematics felt disjointed. Discovering this intersection was captivating---I've had an insatiable interest in control and systems theory ever since. 

In my next academic adventure as a master's student at Northwestern University, I worked on data-driven control theory, an infusion of classical control theory with modern machine learning techniques. This work culminated in my master's thesis [*Increasing Robustness in Koopman-Based Feedback Stabilization*](/documents/Bosnich_NU_Thesis.pdf). Now, I'm pursuing a Ph.D. in mathematical control theory at Washington University in St. Louis, where I'm invesigating fundamental questions related to feedback stabilizability of ensemble contol systems with [Xudong Chen](https://sites.wustl.edu/chen/).

Outside of academics, I love being outdoors and seize every opportunity to sit and soak up nature, especially in the Rocky Mountains. Some of my favorite hobbies are gardening, playing and watching soccer, rock climbing, going to concerts, and reading. See my [interests]({{< ref "other_interests" >}}) for more details and pictures.

I hope you enjoy poking around this website, and please reach out if you want to connect!
