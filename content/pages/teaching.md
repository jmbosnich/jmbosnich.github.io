## Loyola University

**Course Instructor**
- Fall 2024: [Math 118 - Precalculus II](https://www.luc.edu/math/academics/courses/math118/) (two sections)
<!-- - Spring 2025: [Math 118 - Precalculus II](https://www.luc.edu/math/academics/courses/math118/) (two sections) -->
Teaching math at a university is a dream come true! I'm looking forward to teaching two sections of the same precalc course in the spring and to TA-ing (maybe even teaching) courses while pursuing a PhD.

## Northwestern University

**Teaching Assistant**
- Spring 2023 & 2024: [Mech_Eng 314 - Machine Dynamics](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/mechanical/academics/courses/descriptions/314-theory-of-machines-dynamics.html)

During my two stints as TA (and one stint as course grader in Fall 2024), I gave a total of 26 lectures. I lectured on: 
- the derivation and modeling application of the Euler-Lagrange equations for free, constrained, and forced systems
- Noether's theorem and its application to validating numerical integration schemes
- Impact update equations for elastic, inelastic, and plastic impacts

While at Northwestern University, I also participated in the [Mentored Discussions on Teaching](https://searle.northwestern.edu/programs-services/programs/program-pages/mentored-discussions-of-teaching.html) program, which is a part of [CIRTL](https://searle.northwestern.edu/programs-services/cirtl-northwestern/). In this program I learned from a faculty mentor about effective teaching methods, especially in the context of STEM education.

## University of Colorado, Boulder

**Learning Assistant**

- Fall 2017: [APPM 1350 - Calculus 1 for Engineers](https://www.colorado.edu/amath/academics/course-catalog/appm-1350-calculus-1-engineers)
- Spring 2018: [APPM 1360 - Calculus 2 for Engineers](https://www.colorado.edu/amath/appm-1360-calculus-2-engineers)

As an undergraduate learning assistant, I helped students better understand and master course content during weekly work groups.
