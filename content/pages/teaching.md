## Loyola University

**Instructor**
- Fall 2024: [Math 118 - Precalculus II](https://www.luc.edu/math/academics/courses/math118/) (two sections)
<!-- - Spring 2025: [Math 118 - Precalculus II](https://www.luc.edu/math/academics/courses/math118/) (two sections) -->
I'm also scheduled to teach two sections of Math 118 in Spring 2025, though this is subject to change. While I had experience lecturing at Northwestern University, this is my first experience running a course for an entire semester! It has been quite enjoyable and very educational (perhaps even more so to me than the students).

## Northwestern University

**Teaching Assistant**
- Spring 2023 & 2024: [Mech_Eng 314 - Machine Dynamics](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/mechanical/academics/courses/descriptions/314-theory-of-machines-dynamics.html)

I taught a total of 26 lectures over the course of these two stints as TA (and one stint as course grader in Fall 2024). In these lectures, I covered the derivation and application of the Euler-Lagrange equations, in the case of free, constrained, and forced systems; Noether's theorem and application to validating numerical schemes; impact update equations for elastic, inelastic, and plastic impacts.

While at Northwestern University, I also participated in the [Mentored Discussions on Teaching](https://searle.northwestern.edu/programs-services/programs/program-pages/mentored-discussions-of-teaching.html) program, which is a part of [CIRTL](https://searle.northwestern.edu/programs-services/cirtl-northwestern/). This program facilitated mentorship and invesigation of the best pedagogical practices, especially in STEM education.
