I've had the privelege of working on a truly diverse set of projects spanning the gamut of STEM. Whether working on the classification of 10-dimensional simple Lie algebras over GF(2) or building a soft-robotic gripper with force feedback control, I've found all of these projects engaging, challenging, and inspiring. I hope you enjoy reading about these projects below.
